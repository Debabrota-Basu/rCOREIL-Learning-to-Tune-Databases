@@@ Using OLTP-Benchmark

1. Create an empty database for TPC-C. Run the following command in the *DB2* command window. 

db2 create db TPCC

In case that the TPCC database already exists (and even being used), run the following commands to drop it. 

db2 connect reset
db2 drop db TPCC


2. Download and install OLTP-Benchmark. Run the following commands in a *normal* command window. 

cd <some_dir>
git clone https://github.com/oltpbenchmark/oltpbench.git
cd oltpbench
ant

Note: You must install Apache Ant before hand. See instructions: http://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html


3. Copy and rename config/sample_tpcc_config.xml to config/db2_tpcc_config.xml, and edit it with the following basic modification: 

    <!-- Connection details -->
    <dbtype>db2</dbtype>
    <driver>com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver</driver>
    <DBUrl>jdbc:db2://127.0.0.1:50000/TPCC</DBUrl>
    <username>USERNAME</username>
    <password>PASSWORD</password>
    <isolation>TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE</isolation>

Note: Replace USERNAME and PASSWORD according to your settings.


4. Stay in the oltpbench folder and run the following commands for different purposes. 

(1) Create the tables. (--> for initialization)

oltpbenchmark.bat -b tpcc -c config\db2_tpcc_config.xml --create=true

(2) Clear the current records

oltpbenchmark.bat -b tpcc -c config\db2_tpcc_config.xml --clear=true

(3) Load in data without creating the tables. 

oltpbenchmark.bat -b tpcc -c config\db2_tpcc_config.xml --load=true

(4) Run the TPC-C benchmark. (--> for testing)

oltpbenchmark.bat -b tpcc -c config\db2_tpcc_config.xml --execute=true -s 5


5. Collect the TPC-C SQL statements. Assume that the TPCC database is just newly initialized. Do the following steps. 

#1. Connect to the TPCC database. 

db2 connect to TPCC

#2. Create an event monitor for SQL statements. 

db2 "CREATE EVENT MONITOR stmon FOR STATEMENTS WRITE TO FILE '<some_dir>'"

#3. Turn on the event monitor. 

db2 "SET EVENT MONITOR stmon STATE = 1"

#4. Launch the TPC-C benchmark. Refer to 4.(2). 

#5. Turn off the event monitor. 

db2 "SET EVENT MONITOR stmon STATE = 0"

#6. Translate event monitor into readable stuff. (This is the output we want!)

db2evmon -path <dir_in_#2> > <some_file>

#7. Delete the event monitor. 

db2 "DROP EVENT MONITOR stmon"

Note: Step #4 should run in a *normal* command window under the oltpbench folder. Steps #1-#3 and #5-#7 must run in the same *DB2* command window.

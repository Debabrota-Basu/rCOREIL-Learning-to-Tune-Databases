/**
 * The Permutations class provides an iteration of all permutations of an list
 * of objects. Each permutation is simply an ordered list of the group.
 * <p>
 * For example, to see all of the ways we can select a school representative and an 
 * alternate from a list of 4 children, begin with an array of names:: 
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     List<Children> children = Collections.asList({Leonardo, Monica, Nathan, Olivia});
 * </pre></blockquote> 
 * To see all 2-permutations of these 4 names, create and use a Permutations enumeration: 
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * Permutations<Children> c = new Permutations<Children>(children, 2);
 * while (c.hasNext()) {
 *  List<Children> perm = c.next();
 *  for (int i = 0; i < perm.size(); i++) {
 *    print(perm.get(i) +  );
 *  }
 * println();
 * }
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * This will print out:
 * <blockquote><pre> 
 * Leonardo Monica 
 * Leonardo Nathan 
 * Leonardo Olivia 
 * Monica Leonardo 
 * Monica Nathan 
 * Monica Olivia 
 * Nathan Leonardo 
 * Nathan Monica 
 * Nathan Olivia 
 * Olivia Leonardo 
 * Olivia Monica 
 * Olivia Nathan
 * </pre></blockquote>
